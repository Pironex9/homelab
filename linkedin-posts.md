## Post 1 — Hook/Overview (done)

Most people spend their evenings watching TV. I spent mine building a homelab.

18 months ago I had zero IT infrastructure experience.

August 2024, first server. A Raspberry Pi, bare metal, no idea what I was doing.
March 2025, everything migrated to Docker Compose.
December 2025, upgraded to an HP EliteDesk 800 G4 running Proxmox VE.

Along the way I picked up a CCNA and a Junior System Administrator certification.

Today I run 21 self-hosted services on my own hardware:

Jellyfin, Radarr, Sonarr for media
Immich instead of Google Photos
Vaultwarden instead of 1Password
AdGuard Home blocking ads at the DNS level
Tailscale and Pangolin for remote access
Automated backups, disk health monitoring, uptime alerts

No bootcamp. No IT job. Just curiosity, a lot of broken configs, and the drive to figure it out.

Everything is public on GitHub — compose files, setup guides, every mistake I had to fix.

If you hired someone from a non-IT background, what made them stand out?
